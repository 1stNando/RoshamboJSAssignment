Layout:

Buttons choices ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

Player1 clicks button. Save choice in variable1

player2 clicks button. Save choice in variable2

We then compare the values of choice1 and choice2

Display the winner! And end game/reset


Logic:  
  Choices = R, P, S 

  if variable1 is "Rock" and variable2 is "Paper", paper wraps rock and Player2 WINS!
    but if variable2 is "Scissors", rock breaks the scissors and Player1 WINS!
  
  if variable1 = variable2, then tie


V1 is "Paper", and V2 is "Rock", player1 WINS!
  if V2 is "Scissors", player1 LOOSES!
  if V1 = V2, TIE!
